# Builders Checkpoint

Please read the instructions below carefully. We assume you still have `testem` installed; if not, please run `npm install -g testem`.

* Clone your forked repo to your local machine.
* Run `testem` to run the tests
It's just like TestFirst!

## Procedure

### Rules

This checkpoint is similar to the Bulders Test First exercises â€” reverse engineer each spec, and write code to pass it. **Do not alter** any of the TestSpecs unless instructed to do so; ***all solutions should be written in the empty `.js` files in each folder***.

### Scoring

This checkpoint is scored out of **28 points**. In each suite, the later specs are usually more challenging / valuable. The suites are weighted as follows:

- 00-autocomplete - 4.00 Points
- 01-mine-finder - 5.00 Points 
- 02-keypad-entry - 5.00 Points 
- 03-word-score - 6.00 Points
- 04-sort - 8.00 Points

### Tips

* Each folder has a README.md file; **read the README files** to get an overview of each Test Spec and Point Value, as well as problem concept.
* You are encouraged to `git commit` at regular milestones.

## Submitting

When time is complete or when you finish the code, perform the following:

1. Commit all your changes with `git commit -am "submission for deadline"`.
* **Also**: `git push` your commits back up to your own personal fork on Github.

Good luck!
